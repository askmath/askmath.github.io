<h1>About: Ask Math</h1>
<p>
Have you ever had a question about math but weren’t sure where to ask it?
Have you ever asked your math teacher a question and they just didn’t really answer it? (Maybe they said, "Just because." Or maybe they said, "You’ll need to know this later," but they never clarified why that is.)
Have you ever heard about some mathematical topic or idea, and it sounded cool, but you weren’t even sure how to look it up to learn more, or what to search for?
Have you tried looking up something but you were overwhelmed by the information you found, and none of it was suited for your current level of knowledge?
Have you ever just been afraid to ask a question because you weren’t sure it would be taken seriously?
Then you’ve come to the right place!
</p>  

<p>
We know math, we know how to explain it, and we know how to point you to more resources when we can’t. More importantly, <b>we are interested in your questions!</b>
We are teachers, students, and practitioners of mathematics ourselves, so we totally understand that feeling of <b>wanting to learn more</b>. And, just like you, we have also sometimes dealt with dismissive teachers, poorly written books, and a sheer abundance of information that just doesn’t make sense ... yet. 
</p>
<p>
So, we’re here to help. Whatever your question is, we think it’s awesome, and we will provide an answer that matches what you know now, and how you want it answered. In other words, we strive to be genuinely helpful because <b>we believe everyone can learn mathematics, but everyone needs help sometimes.</b>
</p>
However, here are a few things we simply don’t do:
<ul>
  <li>Homework help. Sorry! You have to do the math, but we will help you make sense of it.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>For example, a homework help question we will dismiss is something like: "How do I factor $x^2 +2x -15$?" (A question like that probably belongs on a site like /r/askmath or /r/cheatatmathhomework, or maybe even Math Stackexchange, depending on the difficulty level.)</li>
      <li>However, a great question we would love to answer is something like: "Why do we care so much about factoring polynomials? What does that accomplish?")</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Research help. Sorry! We can give you an overview of a topic or research area, and possibly even point you to some helpful references, but we can’t help you prove your theorem.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>For example, we will dismiss something like: "I have proven these two lemmas, and I think they can be used to prove this conjecture. Do you have any suggestions?" (Something like that belongs on Math Stackexchange or possibly Math Overflow.)</li>
    <li>However, a great question we would love to answer is: "I’m a college student and I just took an introductory course on combinatorics. What are some 'hot topics' being researched in combinatorics these days?"</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Anything too specific. We want to share questions and answers that will be helpful to others reading this site.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>For example, we will probably dismiss something like: "I’m reading this news article and they mention this piece of data that I don’t understand. Can you check my calculations and tell me how I’m misinterpreting what they said?"</li> 
    <li>However, we might answer a question like that if it would involve us explaining a more general mathematical concept, or if it would allow us to give advice to our readers about making sense of data in the news. In other words, we want to make sure the answer includes actionable advice for others, not just your specific situation.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
Whenever you ask a question, you’ll be prompted to tell us a little about your background and how you’d like our answer to be aimed at your level of knowledge.
Ultimately, we promise to take your questions seriously, whatever they are, and we will do our best to provide actually helpful answers. Because that’s what learning is all about.

So head on over to *ask a question page* and ask away!
