  <ul>
    <li>Have you ever had a question about math but weren’t sure where to ask it?</li>
    <li>Have you ever asked a math question and received an unsatisfactory answer like "Just because" or "You’ll need to know this later," with no further clarification?</li>
    <li>Have you ever heard about a cool mathematical topic, but weren’t sure how to find information to learn about it?</li>
    <li>Have you ever tried looking for something online but couldn't find resources aimed at your current level of knowledge?</li>
    <li>And have you ever been afraid to ask a question because you weren’t sure it would be taken seriously?</li>

    <li>Have you ever had a question about math but weren’t sure where to ask it?</li>
    <li>Have you ever asked your math teacher a question and they didn’t really answer it? Maybe they said, "Just because." Or maybe they said, "You’ll need to know this later," but they never clarified why.</li>
    <li>Have you ever heard about a cool mathematical topic, but you weren’t sure how to search for information to learn more about it?</li>
    <li>Have you tried searching online about something but you were overwhelmed by the information you found, and none of it was suited for your current level of knowledge?</li>
    <li>And have you ever been afraid to ask a question because you weren’t sure it would be taken seriously?</li>

<p>
We know math, we know how to explain it, and we know how to point you to helpful resources. More importantly, <boldcolor>we are interested in your questions!</boldcolor>
We are teachers, students, and practitioners of mathematics ourselves, so we totally understand that feeling of <boldcolor>wanting to learn more</boldcolor>. And we have sometimes dealt with dismissive teachers, poorly written books, and wading through a sheer abundance of information that doesn’t make sense. We know those feelings, too.
</p>
<p>
So, we’re here to help! Whatever your question is, we think it’s awesome, and we will provide an answer that matches what you know now and how you want it answered. We strive to be genuinely helpful because <boldcolor>we believe everyone can learn mathematics</boldcolor> and <boldcolor>everyone needs help understanding it sometimes.</boldcolor>
</p>


<p> There are a few things that we're not trying to do. We aren't here to help with homework, or problems which might be hard but have a straightforward answer.  Platforms like <a href="https://reddit.com/r/learnmath">reddit.com/r/learnmath</a>, <a href="https://reddit.com/r/cheatatmathhomework">r/cheatatmathhomework</a>, or maybe even <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/">math StackExchange</a> are better equipped for those kinds of questions.

</p>

<p>
We also can't answer research-level questions. We'll happily provide overviews of research areas, but we can't help you prove that tricky theorem. <a href="https://mathoverflow.net">MathOverflow</a> is a platform designed for research-level math problems. 
</p>

<p>
    Lastly, we can't help with anything that's time-critical or specific to your individual situation. We want to make sure that questions and answers are things that a broad audience can benefit from, and part of that is taking time and care in crafting answers.  Questions that require immediate solutions or those asking to check calculations or answers to a particular math problem are probably better suited to other platforms.
</p>


<p>
    Here are some concrete examples of questions we love and questions we can't help with.
</p>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li><boldcolor>Happy to help: </boldcolor> "Why do we care so much about factoring polynomials?"</li>
        <li><boldcolor>Can't answer: </boldcolor> "Can you factor $x^2 +2x -15$ for me?"</li>
    </ul>



    <ul>
        <li><boldcolor>Happy to help: </boldcolor> "I just took a class in combinatorics in college. Can you tell me what the 'hot topics' in combinatorics research are these days?"</li>
        <li><boldcolor>Can't answer: </boldcolor> "I proved these two lemmas. Can you explain how to put them together to prove my theorem?"</li>
    </ul>


    <ul>
        <li><boldcolor>Happy to help: </boldcolor> "What is the history of the development of algebra in the Middle East?"</li>
        <li><boldcolor>Can't answer: </boldcolor> "What is the history of the development of algebra in the Middle East? I need to know right now because my paper is due tonight."</li>
    </ul>



  <ul>
    <li><boldcolor>Happy to help: </boldcolor> "How do economists calculate unemployment numbers? What kinds of data do they use?"
    <li><boldcolor>Can't answer: </boldcolor> "I was trying to calculate the unemployment rate from this dataset. I keep getting 8% but the news says 6.5%. What am I doing wrong? "</li> 
    
  </ul>

<ul>
  <li><b>Homework help.</b> Sorry! You have to <i>do the math yourself</i>, but we will help you <i>make sense of it.</i></li>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Bad Example:</i> "How do I factor $x^2 +2x -15$?" (This probably belongs on a site like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askmath/">/r/askmath</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cheatatmathhomework">/r/cheatatmathhomework</a>, or maybe even <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/">Math Stackexchange</a>, depending on the difficulty level.)</li>
      <li><i>Great Example:</i> "Why do we care so much about factoring polynomials? What does that accomplish?"</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Research help.</b> Sorry! We can give you an overview of a topic or research area, and possibly point you to helpful references, but we can’t help you prove your theorem.</li>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Bad Example:</i> "I have proven these two lemmas, and I think they can be used to prove this conjecture. Do you have any suggestions?" (This belongs on <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/">Math Stackexchange</a> or possibly <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/>Math Overflow</a>.)</li>
    <li><i>Great Example:</i> "I'm a college student and I just took an introductory course on combinatorics. What are some 'hot topics' being researched in combinatorics these days?"</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Anything too specific.</b> We want to share questions and answers that will be helpful to others reading this site.</li>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Bad Example:</i> "I'm reading a news article and they mention this piece of data that I don't understand. Can you check my calculations and tell me how I'm misinterpreting what they said?"</li> 
    <li>However, we <i>might</i> answer a question like that if it would involve us explaining a more general mathematical concept, or if it would allow us to give advice to our readers about making sense of data in the news. In other words, we want to make sure the answer includes actionable advice for others, not just your specific situation.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>
Whenever you ask a question, you’ll be prompted to tell us a little about your background and how you’d like our answer to be aimed at your level of knowledge.  
Ultimately, we promise to take your questions seriously, whatever they are, and we will do our best to provide actually helpful answers. Because that’s what learning is all about.
