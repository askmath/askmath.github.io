desc: "This answer is written to be accessible to someone who is comfortable with math at the high school level, but perhaps not beyond. The post might assume comfortability with topics like arithmetic, graphing and solving polynomial equations, and basic facts about counting and probability. A background in calculus or other topics typically not encountered before the college-level will not be assumed."
