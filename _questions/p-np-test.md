First, we need to define what $\mathrm{P}$ and $\mathrm{NP}$ actually are.  While most of the popular discussion about $\mathrm{P}$ and $\mathrm{NP}$ is about *algorithms*, more precisely they are classes of *decision problems*; sets of questions like "Is this list of numbers sorted in ascending order?" or "Is there a way to assign three colors to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color?"  These are questions that take a certain kind of input and produce a "yes" or "no" output.

A particular problem might be in $\mathrm{P}$ and $\mathrm{NP}$ depending on the existence of a *certain kind of algorithm* to come up with the correct answer to the problem.
